# Dotfiles
These are my dotfiles - nothing special
I made the scripts and stuff using AI
This whole repo was made using OpenClaw/ClawdBot/Whatever you call it using gpt5. Really cool stuff. 

Feel free to copy these
This also includes my Package list - Kinda like NixOS but for Arch. 
^ I might try NixOS again ngl it was a decent distro
